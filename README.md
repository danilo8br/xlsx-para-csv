# xlsx-para-csv
Conversion of XLSX files to CSV with the Python language and the QT Designer tool for graphical interface.

The objective of the project was to create a program in which the user informs the path of the file he wants to convert, and the location of the file to be converted.

### Why?

- Just to practice my Python skills more

# First screen

In this first screen, the user will inform the path of the file he wants to convert. Then he will inform the path of the directory that he wants to store the file (in the informed path, it will have to have the name of the file with the extension CSV).

# Second screen

In this second screen, it will show if the file conversion was successful.
